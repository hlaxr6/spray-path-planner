In order to understand and add to the front end code, I belive a replacement should be experienced with git, client-server architecture, and UI design, especially in a game engine such as Unity. Experience with Python would be helpful, as GodotScript is much like Python. Experience with Flask or Django would be great as well. In order to understand the ROS side of things, an understanding of how a C Makefile works is helpful. That being said, I learned a whole lot about these areas while working over the past year, so it wouldn't take a terribly long time to get up to speed, provided that the new hire has an apetite for learning about these things and a solid foundational understanding of programming.
