This is a working catkin ROS workspace that should only need to be copied into a folder and made via catkin_make as long as certain filenames are changed to reflect the current location. 

This was built in Ubuntu 16.04 using ROS Kinetic and Python 2.7. Any other packages used should be compatible with these for proper functionality.

More detailed instructions can be found in RRAD Install Instructions and Usage Instructions as well as any ReadMe file contained within.
