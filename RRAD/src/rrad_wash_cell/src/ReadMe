Test_Parts: contains all of the avilable test parts as well as reduced versions for some and the set of 5 used in the initial analysis.

Test_Data: is one of the specified outputs for the mass planner

Test_Data_NoTime: is the specified output for the massplanner that was used in the initial analysis


file_input_service_final: Opens file selection box and passes filename to the server
	The filepath can be modified to dictate the intial directory

path_storage_server_final: manages communication between the various files and the GODOT interface

ImpingementRos: replaces impingement values with more accurate simulation. Needs the body to be replaced with Braden's work and uncomment the lines that call it in the storage server

PartDataCollector: gathers basic info about the size and scale of all stl files in a defined folder

Full_Analysis: takes all of the data from the mass planner and builds graphs and charts for interpretation

NewPlanner: base path planner for initial path plans, returns a timestamped path for simulation or use with a robot. See code comments for more

MassPlanner: crawls through a base directory for all parts and runs the same process described in NewPlanner for multiple treatments. Any edits to the process of NewPlanner need to be made here as well

New Rework Planner: runs same process as NewPlanner, but it only builds the path for the selected facets.  Any edits to the process of NewPlanner need to be made here as well

NewReworkPlanner and MassPlanner have comments for the sections that differ from NewPlanner, otherwise they may be missing some key information on process that can be found in NewPlanner.

NewVizPlanner: the same as the NewPlanner, but the distance is measured as a percentage of the offset distance as oppossed to teh inverse square, this produces better visuals, but it will be deprecated when the impingement node is added to the system.

TestNewPlanner: launches with TestlaunchBackend to allow testing of new methods before implementation into the other 3 planners
